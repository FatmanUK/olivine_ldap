# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working
with code in this repository.

## What this is

A from-scratch Go reimplementation of OpenLDAP, aiming for behaviour compatibility —
with six deliberate departures: Go instead of C, TLS-only networking, Postgres/GORM
instead of a flat-file database, rootless Podman containers instead of autotools,
crash-only architecture and high-availability through the 12-factor manifesto.

**There must be exactly one plan file for this project.** It is
`~/.claude/plans/a-green-stone-in-the-socket.md`. That directory is shared across
every project on this machine, so other plan files live there too: they belong to
unrelated work and are never read or edited from here. `BOOTSTRAP.md` §2 is the
narrative of what has landed, and the plan file is what is next.

## The C reference is a submodule

This is the single most useful thing to know. The repository itself contains
only Go; the lines of OpenLDAP C that everything is ported from are the
upstream project, vendored as a submodule at `openldap/` and pinned to a
release tag:

```bash
git submodule update --init openldap       # if openldap/ is empty
git -C openldap/ describe --tags --always  # which upstream this is
```

It is read-only reference. Nothing in `openldap/` is ever edited, and the
submodule is moved to a new upstream release deliberately, not incidentally —
bumping it can be catastrophic.

**Check the C before implementing anything that claims to match upstream.**
Several behaviours in this codebase look like bugs until you read the original,
and several plausible-looking assumptions turned out to be wrong when checked.

Constrain Go source to 70 columns wide, counting a tab as 8. Keep functions
short, 40 lines at most.

## Committing

**Commit when ready.** Be aware that all commits are signed. The GPG keychain
is locked and must be unlocked by the user. Therefore the commit might fail
if the user can't unlock the keychain in time. This is intended behaviour.
When a signature fails, report this and stop work. Leave the work staged. The next
prompt is likely to request a commit and then continue work.

**Every commit is signed. Never `--no-gpg-sign`** — not to get past a failure,
not "just this once", not for a doc-only change.

**A commit message says what was *found*, not only what was done.** Divergences
are valuable output, and the message is where they are recorded for whoever reads
the history. Where upstream's behaviour differs from what its source reads like,
say so and cite the file and line.

## The golden-output harness

**Not built yet.** This is the design, and it is the plan's step 5.
Until it exists, nothing in this section describes code you can run.

`internal/golden` will be the oracle. It builds a test database, drives the same
script through OpenLDAP built from the `openldap` submodule and through this
project, and diffs the transcripts. The C runs in a container over TCP; this
project runs in-process. Reading the C and reasoning about it is guesswork;
the harness answers directly.

Upstream ships 113 entries under `openldap/tests/scripts`. That is the corpus
the harness drives — it is not something to invent.
